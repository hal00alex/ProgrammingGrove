Question: What kind of tree would you be? 
Answer: A binary tree since I am so organized 

Question: How would you test a tree or any datastructure? 
Answer: First, I will see how it handles nulls. Then, I will see how it handles different datatypes. i.e if someone passes pointers instead of int 
  Thirdly, I would look at the output/printing functions as different datasctuctures require different scopes and different languages require specail printing syntax. 
  Next, I would create an instance of the object, fill it with test values to practice all the subfunctions if applicable. 
  Lastly, I will test for overflow and destructoion if datastructure in lower level langauge. 
  

Question: How would sell a binary tree to a customer?
Answer: Firstly, I would make sure it is a sorted binary tree as a the tree would have extrmely fast look up times. 
  I would focus on the fact that the binary tree has O(log(n)) time for many functions as time is money for banking software. 
  Then, I would give a demo or draw out what the binary tree looks like behind the scenes since clients like seeing products. 
  
Question: How would you reverse a linked list? 
Answer: Iterate trough the linked list. In loop, change next to prev, prev to current and current to next.

//need the temp varaible! 
Node reversedPart = null;
Node current = start;
while (current != null) {
    //need another temp varaible 
    Node next = current.next;
    current.next = reversedPart;
    reversedPart = current;
    current = next;
}
start = reversedPart
